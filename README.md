## Hello, I'm Luan and I create solutions with software.

Preferably back-end oriented, dealing with abstractions is more fun to me.

I also like reading software architecture books, such as The Mythical Man-Month and Clean Architecture.

---

- ðŸ”§ I've worked with React, React Native and Nodejs with Typescript, and Docker, but I've also got some experience with Ruby on Rails, so something new is alwas welcome.
- ðŸ“š Currently studying Computer Engineering at UFMA.
- ðŸŒ± I'm always looking to build something new, so if you do have something working on, I'd love to hear about and take part in it, may it be a compiler or a web page.
- ðŸ“œ A blog is coming soon, I promise.
- ðŸ‘Ÿ Also I do like running and working out, I won't refuse if you invite me.
- ðŸ“« Reach me at my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luancfalves/) 

### Languages and Tools:

```go
const Languages := []string{ "Typescript", "Javascript", "Java", "Ruby", "SQL"}
const Frameworks := []string{ "React", "React Native", "Nodejs", "Express", "Fastify", "Prisma", "Spring Boot", "Ruby on Rails" }
const Tooling := []string{ "Docker", "Git" }
const Infrastructure := []string{ "Linux" }

type Experience struct {
	Languages    []Language
  Frameworks   []Framework
	Tooling      []Tooling
	Infrastructure []Infra
	CloudProviders []CloudProvider
}

func main() {
	workedWith := Experience{
		Languages:      []Language{ Typescript, SQL },
		Frameworks:    []Framework{ React, Nodejs, Express, Fastify, Prisma, SpringBoot, RubyOnRails },
		Tooling:        []Tooling{ Docker, Git },
		Infrastructure: []Infra{ Linux },
	}

	fmt.Println(workedWith)
}
```
